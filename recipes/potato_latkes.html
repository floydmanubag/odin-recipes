    <h2>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated onion</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
    </ol>
